## Introduction

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain ephemeral development servers. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything needed to install my preferred setup of developer tools is detailed in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Enjoy!

## A Fresh Setup

These instructions are for setting up new machines. Instead, if you want to get started building your own dotfiles, you can [find those instructions below](#your-own-dotfiles).

### Setting up your machine

1. Update the operating system to the latest version
2. Setup an SSH key by using one of the two following methods  
   2.1. If you use 1Password, install it with the 1Password [SSH agent](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/#step-3-turn-on-the-1password-ssh-agent) and sync your SSH keys locally.  
   2.2. Otherwise [generate a new public and private SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) by running:

   ```zsh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollanddd/dotfiles/HEAD/ssh.sh | sh -s "<your-email-address>"
   ```

3. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` with:

    ```zsh
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:hollanddd/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

4. Run the installation with:

    ```zsh
    cd ~/.dotfiles && ./fresh.sh
    ```

5. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> 💡 You can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Make sure you also update the references in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc#L2) and [`fresh.sh`](./fresh.sh#L20) files.

### Cleaning your old Mac (optionally)

After you've set up your new Mac you may want to wipe and clean install your old Mac. Follow [this article](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac) to do that. Remember to [backup your data](#backup-your-data) first!

## Your Own Dotfiles

**Please note that the instructions below assume you already have set up Oh My Zsh so make sure to first [install Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#getting-started) before you continue.**

If you want to start with your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

Go through the [`.macos`](./.macos) file and adjust the settings to your liking. You can find much more settings at [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and [Kevin Suttle's macOS Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/MacOS-Defaults).

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine. Use [their search page](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) to check if the app you want to install is available.

Check out the [`aliases.zsh`](./aliases.zsh) file and add your own aliases. If you need to tweak your `$PATH` check out the [`path.zsh`](./path.zsh) file. These files get loaded in because the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` setting points to the `.dotfiles` directory. You can adjust the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) file to your liking to tweak your Oh My Zsh setup. More info about how to customize Oh My Zsh can be found [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization).

You can tweak the shell theme, the Oh My Zsh settings and much more. Go through the files in this repo and tweak everything to your liking.

Enjoy your own Dotfiles!
